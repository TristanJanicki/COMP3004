Setup a drawer that can be used once logged into the app
  drawer allows you to easily navigate to the home screen, the my signals view, the calendar, 
  and allows you to redirect to the TD Ameritrade login page
  
Setting up the drawer required me to also change the classes inside the drawer from appCompatActivities to Fragments
  this itself took a bit of time as coding in a fragment is differnt from an activity
